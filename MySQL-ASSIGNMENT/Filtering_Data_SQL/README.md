## ▶️ How to Run

1️⃣ Open **MySQL Workbench** or any MySQL client  
2️⃣ Import the Sales Transaction dataset into your database  
3️⃣ Open the file `DA_Session_24_SQL_Assignment_MySQL.sql`  
4️⃣ Execute queries **section-wise** to understand each concept

## 📊 Final Output (Expected State)

📁 After execution, the queries return:

* Transactions with **high sales values**
* Category-wise **transaction counts**
* Regions with **high total revenue**
* Regions with **high average transaction value**
* Identification of **missing payment methods**
* Sorted transaction lists for analysis

⚠️ Output may vary depending on the dataset values —  
this is **expected and correct behavior**.
